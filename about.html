        <h1>Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>

        <p>
          After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
          Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code
          reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

      <h2>How I Stayed Commited to Learning</h2>

      <p>
        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
        and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
        learned or work new techniques into existing projects. While that was
        fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and
        most things about my journey with the world.
      </p>

      <h2>How I got started</h2>

      <p>
        started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take
        notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my
        notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
        summaries of what I learned using my own words. That helped me grok what
        I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was
        also helping others learn and stay motivated.
